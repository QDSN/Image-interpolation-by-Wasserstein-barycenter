# Image-interpolation-by-Wasserstein-barycenter
The center of gravity, defined by the Wasserstein distance instead of the Euclidean distance, produces a blur-free intermediate image between the multiple images. By adjusting the weights used to compute the center of gravity, one can adjust which reference image is closer. The optimization of the Wasserstein distance is based on the sinkhorn algorithm, which solves the optimization problem with entropy constraints. The library is Python optimal transport.
